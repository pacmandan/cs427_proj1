We search through complete sentences, then partial sentences, then for keywords before giving up and just placing a randomly chosen word into a pre-made sentence for the word type. If a complete, partial or keyword match has multiple sentences to answer with, a sentence is randomally chosen. If no match can be made, even with parsing, a default answer of "I don't understand." is displayed.
